7 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * no-console:
    - Custom console methods, if they exist, will no longer be allowed.
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions:
    - The TSLint optional config "allow-new" is the default ESLint behavior and will no longer be ignored.
  * brace-style:
    - ESLint's brace-style will check all tokens.
  * @typescript-eslint/quotes:
    - Option "jsx-single" is not supported by ESLint.
  * eqeqeq:
    - Option "smart" allows for comparing two literal values, evaluating the value of typeof and null comparisons.
  * camelcase:
    - Leading undescores in variable names will now be ignored.
    - ESLint's camel-case rule does not allow pascal or snake case variable names. Those cases are reserved for class names and static methods.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading and trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be ignored.
